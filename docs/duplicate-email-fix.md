# 🔧 Duplicate Email Issue - Quick Fix

## 🚨 **Problem Identified:**
- User "Omer" (ID: `cook-1754434802135-wqy8vj2gw`) tried to change email to `yilmazlarfarukomer@gmail.com`
- But that email is already used by user "Test" (ID: `cook-1754433811669-50ddcjq90`)
- Database prevents duplicate emails (which is correct security behavior)

## ✅ **Solution Implemented:**

### **1. Better Error Handling:**
- ✅ Added email uniqueness check before attempting update
- ✅ Improved error messages for duplicate email conflicts
- ✅ User-friendly alert: "This email address is already in use by another account"

### **2. Email Validation Flow:**
```
User changes email → Check if new email exists → If exists, show error → If available, proceed with update
```

## 🧪 **How to Test the Fix:**

### **Option 1: Use a Different Email**
1. Try changing email to a new, unused email address
2. System should work correctly and require re-verification

### **Option 2: Clean Up Test Data**
Since you have test accounts with conflicting emails, you can:
1. Use different email addresses for testing
2. Or delete the test user that's using the conflicting email

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior Now:**

### **✅ When Email is Available:**
```
Change email → Check uniqueness → Email available → Update profile → Redirect to verification
```

### **❌ When Email is Taken:**
```
Change email → Check uniqueness → Email taken → Show error: "Email already in use"
```

## 📧 **Suggested Test Emails:**
- `omer.test1@example.com`
- `omer.cook@example.com`  
- `omer.homecook@test.com`
- Any other unique email address

The system now properly handles duplicate email errors with clear user feedback!
