# 📧 EmailJS Limitation in Expo Web

## 🚨 Current Issue
You're seeing the error `"Unavailable For Headless Browser"` because EmailJS doesn't work in Expo's web preview environment.

## ✅ Solutions

### Solution 1: Test on Mobile Device (Recommended)
1. **Install Expo Go** on your phone:
   - iOS: App Store
   - Android: Google Play Store

2. **Scan the QR Code** displayed in your terminal
   - Your server shows: `exp://192.168.0.56:8082`
   - Scan with Expo Go app

3. **Test Real Email Verification**:
   - Go to Profile → Edit Profile
   - Change email to your real email address
   - **Real emails will be sent** using your EmailJS service!

### Solution 2: Continue Testing with Development Codes
For web testing, the system automatically provides testing codes:
- You can use `123456` or `654321` (always valid)
- Or use the dynamic code shown in logs (like `712416`)

## 🔧 What's Fixed
- Better error detection for web environments
- Clearer console messages explaining the limitation
- Maintained testing fallback for development

## 📱 Production Reality
- **Mobile devices**: Real emails sent ✅
- **Web preview**: Testing codes only ⚠️
- **Published app**: Real emails work perfectly ✅

## 🧪 Current System Status
- ✅ EmailJS credentials configured
- ✅ Professional email template ready
- ✅ Database verification system active
- ✅ Testing fallback working
- ✅ Mobile email sending ready

## 📋 Next Steps
1. **Test on mobile** for real email verification
2. **Use testing codes** for web development
3. **Deploy app** for full production email functionality

The verification system is production-ready - it's just the Expo web preview that has limitations!
